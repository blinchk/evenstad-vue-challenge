## Exercises
1. The Developer only had time to implement Melee attack, but Ranged attack wasn't completed. Please implement it.
 - Bonus - make a bit more interesting algorithm for damage calculation
2. Our hero is kindof OP, because enemy did not get any chance to do counter-attacks. Please give him a fair fighting chance.
 - Bonus - maybe we could do and show battlelogs? (hint - Snackbars from Vuetify could be used for info)
3. The Designer was a bit lazy and didn't account for different card sizes. Please make both cards the same height. (hint - Vuetify has helper classes, which could help here)
 - Bonus - let's add some flair to the app itself! Anything to make it more fun.
4. Anything, what you can think of and want to try out!
